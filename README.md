# hacker-news-tracker

Make an app that can help me track relevant stories of a given week from hacker news using the algolia API. 

For me relevant stories are ones that contain a mention of the following keywords codegen, code, llm. I want to potentially be able to edit these keywords

I want to be able to see the storeis rankes by number of votes, the title, the linked page

Here are some examples of how algolia HN API can be used: 

Examples
All stories matching foo
http://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search?query=foo&tags=story
All comments matching bar
http://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search?query=bar&tags=comment
All URLs matching bar
http://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search?query=bar&restrictSearchableAttributes=url
All stories that are on the front/home page right now
http://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search?tags=front_page
Last stories
http://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search_by_date?tags=story
